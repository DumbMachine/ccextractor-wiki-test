# Project Nephos

//Developed under Google Summer of Code, 2018 with CCExtractor Development By [Shivam Kumar Jha](https://github.com/thealphadollar)//

## Introduction

Project Nephos aims at simplifying the process of moving samples from local storage to cloud for Universities by automating, almost, all the steps involved. It consists of three independent modules; recording module, processing module, and uploading module.

The recording module is responsible for managing the addition of channel lists, set up of recording jobs and saving the recorded streams. The processing module parses saved samples, associates tags, extracts subtitles and converts the video files to MP4 to reduce the file size. The uploading module then uploads the processed stream files to FTP server (if config is completed) and Google Drive, and also shares the sample with other universities (whose email addresses must be provided) if required.

Nephos has been developed, using Python and few other open source projects, to accomplish all the above-mentioned tasks with cent-percent reliability and zero failures (unless wrong data is input, which will get logged). Testing and logging has been an integral part of Nephos development and running cycle, respectively.

* ''git clone https://github.com/thealphadollar/nephos.git'' && ''cd nephos''

* On centOS 6 run the script, ''sudo ./install.sh''

* Observe and modify configurations available in ''$HOME/Nephos/config'' (especially maintenance and module configurations, and processing script)

* Add nephos_start.sh as a cron job to be executed at startup in root crontab. ''@restart /path/to/nephos_start.sh 2&> ~/Nephos/boot_start.log''
    

* Run nephos using ''sudo ./nephos_start.sh''. This command runs Nephos under a new screen session. Press ''ctrl + a'' and then ''d'' to detach from the session while it keeps running in the background.

* You can see the recordings in [ Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) of your linked Google Account. **The logs of the program are uploaded to "Nephos_Logs" folder for Redhen account.**


## To Add Channels And Jobs

Please go to [Nephos Config](https://www.github.com/thealphadollar/NephosConfig) repository to modify the channels, jobs and share lists that Nephos works on.

## Developer's Documentation

Developers can view the documentation that is present for users since it is detailed and one needs to read it in order to understand how Nephos functions. Along with that, docstrings have been placed in HTML format in docs/DevDocs and can be accessed in a systematic manner by opening ''docs/DevDocs/nephos.html'' in a browser.

They can also be viewed [here](https://thealphadollar.github.io/NephosDevDocs/).
