Carlos is currently in San Francisco.

An important thing: CCExtractor changes always become part of the mainstream version. We don't keep one open source version and many private versions for clients.

Work related to CCExtractor that does not require changes to CCExtractor itself (GUIs, monitoring system, integration with 3rd party software) can be closed source, subject to NDAs, etc. 

In general jobs are offered to everyone in the team as this encourages developers to continue their involvement with CCExtractor. This means that even if Carlos is the first point of contact, it's likely that someone else from the team will be available to help with the job.
