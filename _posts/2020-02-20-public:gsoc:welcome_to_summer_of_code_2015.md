#####  Welcome

This is CCExtractor's GSOC 2015 Wiki. 

Red Hen has another document system (generic, not GSoC-specific), please ask Mark or Francis for access. It is fine to create Red Hen pages here (by anyone) if it's found to be more convenient.

About this wiki:

* Anyone with access can edit existing pages and create new ones.\\ 
* It is expected to contain all relevant information. If it's not here it doesn't exist :-)\\ 
* It will eventually contain sensitive information (such as passwords), therefore make sure your own access credentials to the wiki are not shared with 3rd parties.\\ 
* We use dokuwiki. It's quite easy to use, but you should check out [its documentation](http://gsocwiki.ccextractor.org/doku.php?id=wiki:syntax) before you start editing.\\
