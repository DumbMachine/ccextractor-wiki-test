====== Poor Manâ€™s Rekognition ======
==  Mentor : Johannes Von Lochter ==


Developed under Google Summer of Code, 2019 with CCExtractor Development By Amit Kumar

===== Introduction =====

The main aim of the project is to make an open-source version of Amazon Rekognition which is a (paid) service that is able to identify objects, people, text, scenes, and activities in a picture. To accomplish this, I proposed a solution by using tech stacks such as Django, Django-Rest-Framework, ffmpeg, TensorFlow Serving and ReactJS.
