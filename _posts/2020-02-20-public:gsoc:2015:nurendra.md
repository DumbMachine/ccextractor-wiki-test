## Contribution to blog

The subtitles generated by CCExtractor can now be translated and be made available to
a larger audience due to the realtime translation tool.\\
The tool uses Google Translate and Apertium to provide online and offline translation
respectively.\\
The Statistics website collects data from Twitter using Twitter API, from TV advertisements\\
using CCExtractor and shows it effects on the Stock Price which are updated using Google \\
Finance. This will be very useful for opinion collection and looking at the effects of\\
advertisements on Social Media.
