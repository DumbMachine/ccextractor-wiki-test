====== Mouseless for Linux ======

**Introduction**\\
[[https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mouseless|Mouseless]] is a nice tool to practice keyboard shortcuts for a few popular apps. Unfortunately it's only available for Mac. We'd like to create an open-source Linux version that can be easily extended. 

**Your job**\\
We don't want to clone Mouseless (we don't have any relationship with their authors, and we don't want to copy any of their work) - but the idea is good, and we think we can do a good job doing a tool that does a similar job of training users to use the mouse less and the keyboard more, but for the usual Linux tools.

We don't know what's the best technology is to build this, so we're open to ideas. Just come up with a good plan, and a proof of concept for any Linux tool you like.

**Qualification tasks**\\
