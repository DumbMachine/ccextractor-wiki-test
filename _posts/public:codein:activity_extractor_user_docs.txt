====== User Documentation for Activity Extractor======
Activity Extractor aims to extract and download viewing activity from popular video streaming services including: Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. This process is automated and needs very little user interaction. It can be called from the command line with the streaming service as a parameter, and it outputs the viewing activity into a simple .txt file.

The program requires the user to have a valid login and password for the streaming service they wish to retrieve viewing activity from.
