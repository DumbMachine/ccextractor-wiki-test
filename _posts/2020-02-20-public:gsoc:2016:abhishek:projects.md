## Technical Documentation

The technical documentation about the code architecture and how to add support for new services has been written in the [ Technical Documentation Wiki](/ccextractor-wiki-test/2020/02/20/-ccextractor-wiki-test-2020-02-20--ccextractor-wiki-test-2020-02-20--ccextractor-wiki-test-2020-02-20-http:--www.ccextractor.org-doku.php?id=public:gsoc:subtitle_extractor_technical_docs)

## About the Project

The project deals with downloading of subtitles from popular online TV Services like Netflix, BBC,Hulu. The project aims to perform this task without the need for the user to interact with the browser. The process is automated completely. The user just needs to input the URL of the video and the application will download the subtitles.\\
For services like YouTube, CrunchyRoll which have subtitles in multiple languages, the user gets an option to choose the preferred language. \\
For Netflix, Amazon the user needs to have a valid login and subscription to the videos, only then the subtitles will be downloaded.  \\

The whole application was written from scratch. It was coded in Python 3 and it uses a few external libraries like BeautifulSoup, selenium for Python.

#### Future Work

In the future support for new services like ComedyCentral, Channel5 will be added.
As the application depends on the individual services websites, the repository will be checked regularly for errors. Accordingly the bugs would be tackled.
I also plan upon adding features like -

* Batch Downloading of Subtitles. (Currently on Amazon supports this feature)

* Choice of episode selection.

* Preference for file naming.
