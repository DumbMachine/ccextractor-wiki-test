==== CEA-708 ====

CEA-708 is the latest standart for ATSC DTV closed captioning. DTVCC (DTV Closed Captions) decoding and output was improved by Oleg during this summer. Along with major refactoring, more control commands support was added. Now ccextractor can handle 16 bit encoded captions in DTVCC streams, so lots of non-latin languages symbols could be extracted. Output to popular subtitles formats such as SAMI, Transcript and Timed transcript was added. Colored and styled captions will be extracted with information about it (where applies). Rolling up DTVCC  support was also implemented.


=== Technical Details ===

Work done is based on CEA-708-D specification.

Re-encoding characters is done using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconv|iconv]]. To make it work on Windows, [[https://github.com/win-iconv/win-iconv|win-iconv]] implementation is used.

To check what encodings/charsets are supported by iconv, visit [[http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv|libiconv website]]

=== How to use ===

There is a **-svc** (or **--service**) argument, that enables processing of DTVCC. Arguments' value is a comma delimited numbers of streams, e.g. "1,3,62". If it is known that one of the services contains 16-bit characters, then you can pass charset or encoding right after service number, e.g. "1[EUC-KR],3[EUC-CN],62".

If you don't know what services source video file contains, or you would like to extract all existing, you can pass "all" as an arguments' value. To specify charset or encoding pass "all[CHARSET]".

So, for example, to extract DTVCC from [[ftp://37.59.63.18:64900/Korean708D/mbc.ts|Korean sample]], run:

<code>
$ ./ccextractor mbc.ts -svc 1[EUC-KR]
</code>

=== How to evaluate ===

Try to extract captions from files located in Korean708D, Cristiano708 and Cristiano708_2 directories on ccextractors' ftp server. Korean samples store captions in EUC-KR encoding, so specify charset in services argument: -svc 1[EUC-KR].
