# Rotating capture system with HDHomeRun

This is Carlos' quick and dirty solution to have a grid with captions from all stations using a few tuners, obviously by rotating them to cover all channels.

File directories:

* /bin/ -> Scripts

* /channels/ -> Channels, each file being a channel. If name starts with a C then it's cable, if it's a B it's  broadcast, anything else is ignored.

* /tuners/ -> One file per tuner, with this naming\\     $devicetype-$tunertype-$masterorregular-$deviceid-$tunernumber\\ where\\ $devicetype is always HDR (for now only HDHomeRun is supported)\\ $tunertype is USC (US-cable) or USB (US-broadcast)\\ $masterorregular is M or R, if M then this tuner will be used to scan for channels by the chanscan script that populates the /channels/ directory\\ $deviceid is the device ID. For HDHomeRun is returned by hdhomerun_config\\ $tunernumber is the number within the device, so for a device with 3 tuners it's 0-2

Scripts:


* /bin/tuner_scan -> Discover HDHomeRun devices and features, build contents of /tuners/

* /bin/channel_scan -> Scan for channels, build contents of /channels/

* /bin/cc_boot -> Starts one capture process per tuner

* /bin/cc_capture -> Using one of the tuners, capture data from a channel in round-robin

The /channels/ directory contains one file per channel. When a channel is being recorded its file must be renamed to $name.inuse. When done, touched, then renamed back to $name.free. If a process attempts to rename a channel file and fails it must assume that some other process picked up that channel and must continue to the next one.

The cc_capture script always reads contents of /channels/ and picks the oldest file that is free (meaning there isn't another process capturing it). 

Done:

*  Create system user (/ccextractor-wiki-test/2020/02/20/captions), copy public key

*  Edit sudoers

To-do:

*  Create tuner_scan

*  Create channel_scan

*  Create cc_capture

*  Create cc_boot
