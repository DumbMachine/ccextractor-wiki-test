## Working with HDHomeRun

Starting in version 0.65, CCExtractor can process a stream being delivered via UDP, so there's no need to capture video to a file in order to get the subtitles.

**What devices are supported?**
While it should work with any device that is able to send the stream via UDP, at this time it's only been tested with HDHomeRun (both European and American models).

**Will other devices be supported?**

HDHomeRun works so well that it's unlikely I'll bother with any other device unless it finds its way to me for free and development is sponsored.

**How do I use it?**

Make sure you have HDHomeRun's software installed. You will need the command line tool "hdhomerun_config" (it's available for Linux and Windows, possibly OSX too). GUI frontends are available, too, but the following instructions use just the command line tool.

Because you can have more than one HDHomeRun in the network, the first thing is to look for the IDs of each of them:

	
	# ./hdhomerun_config discover
	hdhomerun device 12206E95 found at 192.168.20.117


I only have one, and its ID is 12206E95. When I want to do anything with that tuner, I need to pass the ID to hdhomerun_config (note: since I only have one I could just pass FFFFFFFF which is accepted in this scenario).

**Then, have HDHomeRun scan for channels:**

	
	./hdhomerun_config 12206E95 scan /tuner0


The first parameter is of course the ID of my HDHomeRun. I also need to pass /tuner0 because the device is dual-tuner, so I specify which one I want to use. The output is rather large - only a part of it is shown:

	
	SCANNING: 778000000 (eu-bcast:59)
	LOCK: t8qam64 (ss=90 snq=66 seq=100)
	TSID: 0x000F
	PROGRAM 184: 0 Boing
	PROGRAM 185: 0 Telecinco HD
	PROGRAM 304: 0 MTV
	PROGRAM 305: 0 Paramount Chann
	SCANNING: 770000000 (eu-bcast:58)
	LOCK: t8qam64 (ss=97 snq=28 seq=100)
	TSID: 0x03F4
	PROGRAM 530: 0 La 1
	PROGRAM 531: 0 La 2
	PROGRAM 532: 0 24h
	PROGRAM 533: 0 Clan
	PROGRAM 535: 0 Radio Nacional
	PROGRAM 536: 0 Radio 5 Todo No


In this output, the number after eu-bcast is the channel. A channel is a bundle of several programs (a program being a station) that are broadcast together. For example you can see that channel 58 contains 6 programs.

Suppose we want the subtitles from "La 1". First, tune to the channel that carries it:

	
	#./hdhomerun_config 12206E95 set /tuner0/channel 58


Then, select the specific program. Note that we could get away without selecting a program and then the HDHomeRun would deliver all of them to CCExtractor. However because CCExtractor only processses only program at a time it's best to filter directly in the tuner than have CCExtractor discard everything it doesn't need.

	
	./hdhomerun_config 12206E95 set /tuner0/program 530


Finally, tell HDHomeRun where to send the stream to:

	
	./hdhomerun_config FFFFFFFF set /tuner0/target 192.168.20.15:1235


The parameter there is the IP address of the computer where CCExtractor is running (or will be running) and the port it's listening to. CCExtractor can be running already when you do this, or you can start it at a later point. Of course the stream before it's started is lost - it will start processing data as it arrives from the tuner.

Finally, start CCExtractor if you hadn't done it already:

As expected, in this example CCExtractor would run forever. You can control this with the time related parameters, in case you want CCExtractor to exit after a given number of seconds.
