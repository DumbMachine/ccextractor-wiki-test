**CCExtractor's source code**

[[https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor/releases/download/v0.88/ccextractor-0.88_no_windows.zip|CLI Source code without Windows blobs (reduced size)]]

**Windows binaries**

[[https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor/releases/download/v0.88/ccextractor.0.88-windows.binaries.zip|Windows binaries]] (just the GUI and the command line programs, without installation)

[[https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor/releases/download/v0.88/ccextractor_0.88_windows_installer.exe|Windows installer, first attempt with InstallShield - if it doesn't work just use the zipped binaries above]]

Note: Starting with 0.84 we're bundling two binaries for the main program: With and without OCR. The reason is that the OCR (needed to convert the bitmap based European DVB subtitles into .srt, and also DVD) has its own dependencies, which may or may not be available in the user system. So if you don't need the OCR and don't feel like fighting with dependencies just use the non-OCR version which has no external dependencies and should work fine in everything from XP up.

About the Windows installer, we used to generate .msi installers but that seems to be discontinued by Microsoft - Visual Studio generates them with an expired certificate which causes warnings. We've prepared a new installer using InstallShield. Please report issues if any. Things we are already aware of:

- It doesn't check for NET 2.0 being present, because it's too old. However we're still targeting it because for now we don't need anything advanced and NET 2.0 works in XP. If you are wondering why we care about XP it's because it's the last OS that supports some ancient hardware that is still in use that cannot be replaced for a number of reasons.\\
- It says "Unknown publisher", because we currently don't have a code signing certificate.\\
- You need to uninstall any previous version before installing, it cannot just update, even if all it would take is just to overwrite files.\\
