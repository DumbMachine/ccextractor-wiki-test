** Write high speed subtitle synchronization tools **

 Tool A - sync between two versions of the same footage: This is a very common use case: Suppose you have raw recording of a TV show, with commercials, etc, then use CCExtractor get the subtitles from it. Then you remove the commercials, and have a really clean recording, but the subtitles are out of sync since the timing changed the video.

The project is to write a tool that takes:\\
a) The original video\\
b) The edited video\\
c) The subtitles for the original video\\

and produces

d) The subtitles for the edited video

We recommend you use FFmpeg to do the heavy lifting for the video processing and DejaVu as a reference to do the audio fingerprinting which you will need for the synchronization.

A really important requirement is that this is a fast tool. This means that writing a script that first calls FFmpeg to generate a .wav file and then calls DejaVu to locate each segment will definitely not work (and also, it's not a Summer of Code task). You need to write a C program that uses FFmpeg libraries and reimplement the audio fingerprinting in C. This should be “easy” since for DejaVu you have the source code, an amazing explanation of how everything works, and FFmpeg libraries have FFT functions so luckily you don't need to implement them yourself.

You can also come up with a totally different solution that doesn't follow our suggestion as long as it achieves the goal.

Tool B - Suppose you don't have the original video, but you do have the original subtitles from it, so what you have is: a) The subtitles for the original video, which contains subtitles for commercials and possible a few minutes from the previous and following program.
b) The edited version.

Doing the sync now is more difficult as you don't have the original audio or video to compare. But you do have the audio for the edited version from which you can obtain timing for voice. For example if the subtitles for the original video contain three consecutive frames that last 3.45 seconds, 1.54 seconds and 2.34 seconds respectively, and doing audio analysis in the edited video you find 3 segments with voices with similar duration it's likely that they are a match.

Requirements:\\
1) You cannot use any non open source dependency. For example, Mathlab is out, even if the run time is free.\\
2) Your program needs to be usable from a script, so it should be command line based. If there's time, you can definitely provide a GUI, but that's secondary to the main program.\\
3) High speed is really a priority. Prepare to spend time coming up with a good algorithm.\\
4) While GSoC is about coding, you will have to prepare really good documentation. As an example, check out DejaVu's explanation on how everything works (even if you don't use it at all, use it as a baseline of really good technical documentation).\\
5) Must be as portable as the libraries you use. For example FFmpeg builds in linux, windows, etc, so if you use FFmpeg then your program must also build on those platforms.\\

We will provide a fast speed server in which you can work. You don't have to use it, but keep in mind that in general video files are very large. You will need to deal with files that are several gigabytes long. If you have the bandwidth, great. Otherwise you can just work remotely on our development server. \\
