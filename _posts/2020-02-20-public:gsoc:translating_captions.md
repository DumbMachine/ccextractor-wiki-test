## Translating captions

You can use the [cctranslate](https://github.com/kisselef/cctranslate) tool (implemented by Oleg) to translate extracted captions in realtime and in SubRip formatted files. We use the [ Google Translate API](https://cloud.google.com/translate) for translation, but the tool is built so developers can easily add other translation engines.
### How realtime translation works?


 1.  *ccextractor* starts with sharing service on
 2.  *ccextractor* launches *cctranslate* process
 3.  launched instance of *cctranslate* subscribes to *ccextractor*s' messages
 4.  *ccextractor* publishes extracted subtitles to all subscribers
 5.  *cctranslate* requests translation from translation service and saves translated captions to an output file

#### Ok, and what is a "sharing service"?

Sharing service is a [Publisher-Subscriber IPC Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) publisher implementation. It uses [nanomsg](http://nanomsg.org) as a cross-platform socket library, that provides simple interface to implement pub-sub model and supports lots of transport mechanisms. To serialize messages [protobuf-c](https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c) implementation of [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) is used. Both of used solutions are language-independent, so sharing service could be easily used by third-party developers to create new solutions based on ccextractor.

#### What about the cctranslate tool?

Cctranslate tool was designed to be cross-platform and is implemented in C language. It uses:


*  [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl) to perform http/https requests

*  [nanomsg](http://nanomsg.org) as a socket library

*  [protobuf-c](https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c) to parse serialized messages

*  [CJSON](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cjson/) to parse responses from [Google Translate API](https://cloud.google.com/translate/)

Standalone SubRip-formatted files could also be translated using this tool along with realtime translation.

#### Sharing service messaging format

### How to use it?

First, you have to compile it. It uses cmake build automation system, so make sure you have it installed.
For Linux/MacOSX/UNIX use:

	
	$ mkdir build && cd build
	$ cmake ../
	$ make


Make sure nanomsg and libcurl dev packages are downloaded. If your distribution doesn't have a package system or these packages are not supported by maintainer, you can download tarballs and compile it by yourself.

Then, create a [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) account (or use your existing) and generate an API key.

##### Using cctranslate as a standalone text file captions translator

Check what languages are available at the moment:

	
	$./cctranslate --list-langs --key=YOUR_API_KEY

Pick up languages you want your subs be translated to, and run:

	
	$./cctranslate --input=subs.srt --langs=fr,it,th --key=YOUR_API_KEY


##### Using cctranslate for realtime translation

Copy cctranslate tool to ccextractors' binary directory. There are two ways to translate realtime: launch ccextractor with translating mode on and launch cctranslate tool to connect to already running instance of ccextractor.

To launch ccextractor with translating mode on, run:

	
	$ ./ccextractor INPUT_OPTIONS -translate LANGUAGE_LIST -translate-auth YOUR_API_KEY


To connect cctranslate tool to already running instance of ccextractor:

	
	$ ./cctranslate --source=extractor --key=YOUR_API_KEY


In the second case, ccextractor has to be started with sharing service on. To do that add **-enable-sharing** option to arguments. By default, it starts TCP sharing service on localhost:3269. You can set other nanomsg-supported transport type to share captions using **-sharing-url** arg in format transport:address.
