# Using Vagrant

## What is Vagrant?

Vagrant provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments built on top of industry-standard technology and controlled by a single consistent workflow to help maximize the productivity and flexibility of you and your team. Vagrant will isolate dependencies and their configuration within a single disposable, consistent environment, without sacrificing any of the tools you are used to working with (editors, browsers, debuggers, etc.). Once you or someone else creates a single Vagrantfile, you just need to ''%%vagrant up%%'' and everything is installed and configured for you to work. You can read more about the advantages of Vagrant at [https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/why-vagrant/](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/why-vagrant/)

## Installation


*  Install vagrant for your OS [https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

*  Install VirtualBox for your OS [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds) **Warning:** Install VirtualBox **5.0** (Newer versions are not supported yet in vagrant). Version VirtualBox **5.0.30** at the top will be OK

## vagrant up

Download repository of CCExtractor from GitHub [https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor) (Or your fork of this repo)

The repository contains a file Vagrantfile that looks like this

	
	Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
	  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
	
	  # Uncomment this line if you want to sync other folders
	  # config.vm.synced_folder "/home/user/video", "/video"
	
	  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
	    sudo apt-get install -y gcc
	    sudo apt-get install -y libcurl4-gnutls-dev
	    sudo apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr
	    sudo apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr-dev
	    sudo apt-get install -y libleptonica-dev
	  SHELL
	
	end

If you have not Vagrantfile, simply create it in project folder and copy and paste in Vagrantfile all of the code from above.

Here it is clear that the system of the environment (or box, or virtual machine) is Ubuntu 16.04. After 'vagrant up' vagrant installs additional libraries in environment (not on host system!) for compiling CCExtractor.

To start the environment, go to the folder with the project and run:

	
	vagrant up

At first time it may take a while to create virtual machine and install dependencies (about a minute or more), but in the next launches it will take place much faster. This command launch the virtual machine. For stop the virtual machine run:

	
	vagrant halt



## vagrant ssh


To connect to the environment (environment must be launched), run in project folder

	
	vagrant ssh

If you want to return to your computer terminal, run

	
	logout


By default, the project folder is synchronized with environment (that is available in your computer, and in a virtual machine). The project folder is located in /vagrant.

Lets build the project

	
	cd /vagrant
	cd linux
	./build


{{ https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5406399/21139235/4b6c0c9c-c14b-11e6-9fed-d58ea569b854.png }}

Now virtual environment and computer both have built CCExtractor in folder linux. Even if your computer does not have curl, tesseract, leptonica, gcc. Run in environment's linux folder ''%%./ccextractor%%'' and you will see a description of the program. Run ''%%./ccextractor [arguments]%%'' to get subtitles.

## Synced folders

Synced folders - those folders that are both available and in the environment, and on the host computer. Initially synchronized folder is only the project folder (where is Vagrantfile exists). You can synchronize more folders - just uncomment this line in Vagrantfile (delete the character '#' at the beginning of the line)

	
	config.vm.synced_folder "/home/user/video", "/video"

This means that the folder with the path to "/home/user/video" will be available in the envitonment with the path "/video". You can add any number of folders, each folder on your line. Example changed Vagrantfile:

	
	Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
	  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
	
	  config.vm.synced_folder "/home/MyName/video", "/video"
	  config.vm.synced_folder "/home/MyName/Desktop", "/desk"
	  config.vm.synced_folder "/home/MyName/Downloads/videofiles", "/stuff"
	
	  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
	    sudo apt-get install -y gcc
	    sudo apt-get install -y libcurl4-gnutls-dev
	    sudo apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr
	    sudo apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr-dev
	    sudo apt-get install -y libleptonica-dev
	  SHELL
	
	end


Now, after changing Vagrantfile, if you have environment is launched, you have to perform in the host computer terminal ''%%vagrant reload --provision %%'', or if stopped, run ''%%vagrant up%%''

{{ https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5406399/21139417/3b22dfcc-c14c-11e6-9006-7bff3b60fbcf.png }}
Example - subtitles will be created in synced folder /video

You can edit the code from both the host computer and the virtual machine, and build it in virtual machine.
