#  CCExtractor bug hunt

The first 1-2 weeks are to be spent fixing bugs and closing issues in [GitHub](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor/issues ). This applies to all CCExtractor students that are going to be working on the core tool (that's almost everyone). This serves some purposes:

* It's the best way to see first-hand what the problems are :-)\\
* It will let you get used to the code.\\
* It will give us a reliable version that is fun to work with\\

The following table should be populated before the start of the coding period. You can either select your own bugs (just edit the table and add yourself) or they can be assigned to you :-)

The veteran students (Anshul, Ruslan, Willem) are expected to do the hard ones unless someone else do them first. 

When you start working a bug please write it here. Don't wait until it's fixed to avoid the situation in which two people happen to work on the same thing unintentionally. Working on a bug and not being able to actually fix it is OK. Ask for help or discuss it in the mailing list so others can help you figure it out.
