====== CCExtractor tasks ======

This page is a compilation of the most important tasks from everyone's proposals. Those of you that are going to be working on the same things please talk among yourselves. 

Add tasks and edit as needed.

We know that there were some proposals that included the exact same tasks. We preferred to pick the best students and not just the best proposals for each task. If you find yourself in a situation in which someone else is doing what you were planning to do, just replace that task with even a more interesting one :-) Don't get frustrated by this overlap. We are aware of it.
