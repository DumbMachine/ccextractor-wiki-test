**Detect Automatically the most interesting bits of sample videos**

Write software that is able to detect, for some kind of videos, the most interesting bits (highlights). You can use:  

- Audio (for example, [](https://archive.cnx.org/contents/a7ec0ec7-9093-4f55-93ef-3ac2ce71b1c8@3/anatomy-of-a-laugh-track) [](http://archive.cnx.org/contents/8ffeeb0f-fb40-4d3e-a63f-aaff422f9eab@2/primary-detection-methods-for-laugh-tracks))\\
- Video (for example, detect high speed scenes or score changes)\\
- Subtitles  

At a minimum, the following must be detected:\\
- Goals in soccer ([previous work exists](http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/07/04/automatic-soccer-highlights-compilations-with-python/); you can build on it or reimplement)\\
- Three pointers in basketball\\
- Jokes in sitcoms\\
Plus any other 5 use cases you want to work on.
